# OAuth 2.0 on WhiteBIT

OAuth 2.0 integration with WhiteBIT enables secure, token-based authorization for third-party applications to access the WhiteBIT platform on behalf of users. This implementation follows industry standards while providing specialized features tailored for cryptocurrency trading and account management.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Users grant access without sharing their WhiteBIT credentials with third-party applications
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained scope controls allow users to limit what third-party applications can access
- **Streamlined Trading Experience**: Enables seamless integration with portfolio trackers, trading bots, and analysis tools
- **Developer-Friendly**: Standardized implementation familiar to developers across the ecosystem

## How WhiteBIT OAuth Works

1. **Authorization**: Users approve access for a third-party application through WhiteBIT's authorization page
2. **Token Exchange**: The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token
3. **API Access**: The application uses the access token to make API calls to WhiteBIT on the user's behalf
4. **Token Refresh**: When the access token expires, the application can use a refresh token to obtain a new one

## Use Cases

### Trading Bots & Algorithmic Trading
Enable automated trading strategies without storing WhiteBIT credentials in third-party systems. Trading bots can place, modify, and cancel orders while only having the specific permissions they need.

### Portfolio Trackers & Analytics
Allow portfolio management applications to read balance and trade history information without write access to trading functions, providing users with consolidated views of their assets across multiple platforms.

### Mobile Applications
Provide a seamless authentication experience in mobile apps without requiring users to enter and store their WhiteBIT credentials in the app.

### Enterprise Integrations
Enable business systems to securely connect to WhiteBIT for institutional trading, reporting, and compliance purposes with proper audit controls.
