# Private HTTP API Authentication

## Overview

This guide explains how to authenticate with WhiteBit's private HTTP API endpoints, which require authentication for security purposes.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up API Keys

1. Navigate to [WhiteBit API Settings](https://whitebit.com/settings/api)
2. Select the appropriate configuration tab for your API keys
   > Different API keys provide access to different API endpoints
3. Generate a new API key
4. **Recommended Security Measures:**
   - Enable IP restrictions (specify up to 5 trusted IPs)
   - Enable Endpoint access restrictions (select only necessary endpoints)

## Authentication Requirements

All authenticated requests must:
1. Use the `POST` HTTP method
2. Include specific body data
3. Contain required headers

### Body Data Format

Your request body must be a JSON object containing:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `request` | Request path without domain name | `'/api/v4/trade-account/balance'` |
| `nonce` | An incrementing number larger than previous requests | `'1594297865'` |
| `nonceWindow` | Optional boolean to enable time-based nonce validation | `true` |
| Request-specific parameters | Additional parameters required by the endpoint | `"ticker": "BTC"` |

**Example Request Body:**
```json
{
    "request": "/api/v4/trade-account/balance",
    "nonce": 1594297865,
    "nonceWindow": true,
    "ticker": "BTC"
}
```

#### About Nonce Values

- A good practice is to use the Unix timestamp in milliseconds
- Ensure each nonce is larger than previous requests
- When `nonceWindow` is enabled:
  - Provide Unix timestamp in milliseconds as the nonce
  - Timestamp must be within Â±5 seconds of server time
  - Each nonce must be unique to prevent double processing
  - Useful for high-frequency trading systems with concurrent requests

### Required Headers

Every authenticated request requires these headers:

| Header | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `Content-type` | `application/json` | Specifies JSON format |
| `X-TXC-APIKEY` | `your_api_key` | Your public WhiteBit API key |
| `X-TXC-PAYLOAD` | `base64_encoded_payload` | Base64-encoded request body |
| `X-TXC-SIGNATURE` | `signature` | HMAC-SHA512 signature (hex encoded) |

The signature is created using: `hex(HMAC_SHA512(payload, key=api_secret))`

## Implementation Examples

We provide the [API Quick Start Helper](https://github.com/whitebit-exchange/api-quickstart) library with examples in multiple languages:

- Python
- PHP
- NodeJS
- Go
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- DotNet
- Ruby
- C++
- Rust

## Common Errors

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| "Too many requests." | Nonce value is not greater than previous request | Use incrementing nonce values |
| "This action is unauthorized. Enable your key in API settings" | Using disabled API key | Enable key in API settings or check IP restrictions |
| "You don't have permission to use this endpoint." | Endpoint access is restricted | Update endpoint access in API key settings |
| "Invalid payload" | Payload doesn't match decoded value | Ensure proper base64 encoding of request body |
| "Unauthorized request." | Request signed incorrectly | Verify signature creation process |
| "Nonce not provided." | Missing nonce in request body | Include nonce in all requests |
| "Your nonce is more than 5 seconds lesser than the current nonce" | Invalid timestamp when using nonceWindow | Use current timestamp in milliseconds |
| "Invalid nonceWindow." | nonceWindow is not a boolean | Ensure nonceWindow is set to true or false |
| "Request not provided." | Missing request path in body | Include request path in all requests |
