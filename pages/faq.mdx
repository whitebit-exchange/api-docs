# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Rate Limits and Errors

### Q: Why am I getting a 429 error and can't make requests?

If the rate limit for an endpoint is exceeded, you will receive a 429 error. To resolve this:
- Wait for the rate limit window to reset
- Check the specific rate limit value in the endpoint description
- Consider implementing rate limiting in your code

### Q: Why do I get a CORS error when requesting the whitebit.com/api/v4/public/ticker method?

CORS requests to this endpoint are forbidden for security reasons. Make the request from your backend instead of client-side.

### Q: Why am I getting a 403 error when making requests to the Smartplan endpoints?

These endpoints are restricted to B2B partner services only. To gain access:
- Contact [support@whitebit.com](mailto:support@whitebit.com)
- Request permissions for Smartplan endpoints
- Provide your use case details

### Q: How can I check if WhiteBIT services are operational?

For real-time service status and incident updates, visit our [Status Page](https://status.whitebit.com/). You can also check the [Platform Status endpoint](/public/http-v4#maintenance-status) (`/api/v4/public/platform/status`) for programmatic status checks.

## WebSocket and Data Access

### Q: Can I get information on pairs for multiple time periods in the WebSocket Kline method?

There are two solutions:
1. Open multiple WebSocket connections
2. Use the equivalent HTTP method instead

For more details, see the [Kline documentation](https://whitebit-exchange.github.io/api-docs/public/websocket/#kline).

### Q: Why can't I see trade history for a pair in the last 24 hours?

The system only shows the last 100 deals by default. To see more:
- Subscribe to our WebSocket feed
- Accumulate and store the data on your side
- Process the data as needed for your use case

## Authentication and Nonce

### Q: Why am I getting nonce errors?

To resolve nonce errors:
1. Debug your code implementation
2. Recreate your API keys
3. Ensure your system time is properly synchronized

## Balance and Transfers

### Q: Why doesn't the transfer between balances occur when transferring assets via API?

When making transfers and withdrawals:
- Wait for transfers to complete (approximately 2 seconds)
- Don't initiate withdrawals before transfer completion
- Implement proper error handling for transfer states

### Q: I get an error that there are insufficient funds for withdrawal, even though there are assets on the balance.

This occurs when the withdrawal amount plus the fee exceeds your available balance. Remember to:
- Account for withdrawal fees in your calculations
- Check the [fees documentation](https://github.com/whitebit-exchange/api-docs/blob/main/docs/Private/http-main-v4.md#fees)
- Ensure sufficient balance for both amount and fees

## Technical Requirements

### Q: Is https required for Webhook API communication? What port is used?

Yes, HTTPS is required:
- Communication occurs over port 443
- SSL/TLS encryption is mandatory
- HTTP connections are not supported

### Q: How can I check if deposits and withdrawals are available for a specific currency?

You can check currency status through the assets endpoint:
- URL: <RegionalUrl type="api" path="/api/v4/public/assets">/api/v4/public/assets</RegionalUrl>
- This endpoint provides real-time status of all currencies
- Check the currency-specific enabled/disabled flags

## API Keys and Security

### Q: How do I ensure my API keys are secure?

To maintain API key security:
- Never share your API keys
- Store keys securely (use environment variables)
- Restrict IP addresses when possible
- Use the minimum required permissions
- Rotate keys periodically

### Q: What should I do if I suspect my API key is compromised?

If you suspect key compromise:
1. Immediately delete the compromised key
2. Review account activity for unauthorized actions
3. Create new API keys with fresh permissions
4. Update your application with the new keys
5. Contact support if unauthorized activity is detected


## Performance and Optimization

### Q: How can I optimize my API usage for high-frequency trading?

For optimal API performance:
- Use WebSocket for real-time data
- Batch requests when possible
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor network latency

### Q: What's the best way to handle API disconnections?

To handle disconnections effectively:
- Implement automatic reconnection logic
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Maintain local order state
- Log all critical operations
- Set up monitoring and alerts
