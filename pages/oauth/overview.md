# OAuth 2.0 Overview

OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted standard that enables websites and applications to access resources from other web apps on behalf of users. It offers a secure and consent-based approach, ensuring that client apps can interact with resources without compromising user credentials. It's important to note that OAuth 2.0 primarily serves as an authorization protocol, focusing on granting access to specific resources such as remote APIs or user data, rather than an authentication protocol.

In OAuth 2.0, the usage of Access Tokens plays a crucial role. These tokens serve as authorization credentials, representing the permission to access resources on behalf of the end-user. While OAuth 2.0 does not prescribe a specific format for Access Tokens, the JSON Web Token (JWT) format is commonly used in various contexts. JWT allows token issuers to include additional data within the token itself, providing flexibility and extensibility.

Additionally, for enhanced security, Access Tokens often come with expiration dates. This ensures that access to resources is time-limited and reduces the risk of unauthorized usage.
