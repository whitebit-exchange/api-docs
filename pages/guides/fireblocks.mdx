# How to Connect Fireblocks via API?

The Fireblocks Network is a secure transfer system enabling immediate discovery, connection, and transfer of digital assets among exchanges, fiat providers, liquidity partners, and counterparties.

To successfully connect your WhiteBIT account to Fireblocks, you must generate a unique API key and an API secret. These are the credentials required to use an API Hook. Please note that the standard WhiteBIT API key is unsuitable in this case.

Here's a step-by-step instruction on how to generate a Fireblocks API key:

1. **Open "API" â†’ "Integrations."** Enter your WhiteBIT account and find the "API" page in the account settings. In the "API" section, choose "Integrations."

4. **API key and API secret generation.** After successfully entering 2FA, the system will automatically generate a unique API key and API secret. Please note that the API secret will only be visible once. Hence, safely storing the generated API secret is recommended to ensure your data's security.
