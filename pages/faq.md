7. Q: Why doesn't the transfer between balances occur when transferring assets via API? Example: I made a transfer from a trading account to a main account and made a withdrawal request, but I received an error indicating that there were no funds in the balance.

8. Q: I get an error that there are insufficient funds for withdrawal, even though there are assets on the balance.

A: The amount plus the fee was greater than the balance. For the withdraw-pay method, you need to take into account the withdrawal fee [https://github.com/whitebit-exchange/api-docs/blob/main/docs/Private/http-main-v4.md#fees](https://github.com/whitebit-exchange/api-docs/blob/main/docs/Private/http-main-v4.md#fees)
