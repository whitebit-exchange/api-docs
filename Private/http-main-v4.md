### Create withdraw request with the specific withdraw amount (fee is not included)

```
[POST] /api/v4/main-account/withdraw-pay
```
This endpoint has the similar logic as [/main-account/withdraw](#create-withdraw-request), but with the only difference: amount that is specified will not include fee (it will be calculated to make target withdraw amount equal to the specified amount).
                 
Example:
* When you create base withdraw and set amount = 100 USD, receiver will recieve 100 USD - fee amount, and your balance will decrease by 100 USD.
* When you use this endpoint and set amount = 100 USD, receiver will recieve 100 USD, and your balance will decrease by 100 USD + fee amount.
